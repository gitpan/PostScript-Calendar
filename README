PostScript::Calendar version 1.00, released November 11, 2010


PostScript::Calendar generates printable calendars using PostScript.

PostScript::Calendar uses Date::Calc's *_to_Text functions, so you
can change the language used by calling Date::Calc's Language
function before creating your calendar.
