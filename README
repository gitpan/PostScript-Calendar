PostScript::Calendar version 0.06, released September 27, 2010


PostScript::Calendar generates printable calendars using PostScript.

PostScript::Calendar uses Date::Calc's *_to_Text functions, so you
can change the language used by calling Date::Calc's Language
function before creating your calendar.

CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 0.06 of PostScript::Calendar:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- Add a Creator comment only if we create the PostScript::File object
	- Document that passing ps_file => undef creates a new object
	- List the fonts we use even when given a ps_file
	- Force timezone in tests for consistent results
	- Figured out how to avoid Latin-1 in POD (S<C<< >>> works correctly)
